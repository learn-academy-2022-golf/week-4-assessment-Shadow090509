# ASSESSMENT 4: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is object-oriented programming? How is it different than functional programming?

Your answer: From my understanding, that means that most(if not all things are objects) I think this would be slightly easier to mannage and just apply classes to the objects instead of having to create the objects as well.

Researched answer: OOP was made to make it easier to work with large software systems. a way to create containers for data that can be changed and manipulated without messing up the rest of the program.

2. What is the difference between a Float and an Integer in Ruby?

Your answer: an integer is a whole number. and float is a number with a decimal point.

Researched answer: integer is a number without a decimal point. A float is a floating point number and has a decimal place. It seems the difference is that ruby assumes an integer is being used and in order to get a float, you need to include a float in the process. i.e. 1 + 1.5

3. Ruby has an implicit return. What does that mean?

Your answer: if there is no return created, the last command will be automatically returned. like a default.

Researched answer: if there is no return "explicitly" prompted within a method, the value of the last executed instruction is returned. this is a good way to keep track of changes in code or to remind the developer to include a return command.

4. What is a block in Ruby?

Your answer: like an anonymous function.

Researched answer: some typical blocks are do and end. they are passed to a method to determine an outcome. like i said earlier, an anonymous function that is used to keep the comman within a scope.

1. How do you extract a value in a Ruby hash?

Your answer: by calling upon the key/value pair.

Researched answer: calling the hash followed by a key name within brackets grabs the value associated with the key.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. Class Inheritance: The relationship of passing data. this process of putting common behaviors into a shared class, is also known as a "superclass". inheritance is defined with the syntax <

2. RSpec: A language used for the specific task of testing the behavior of objects in Ruby. also known as a Domain specific language.

3. CRUD: -Collects data
   -Reads data
   -Updates data
   -Deletes data

4. Test-driven development: Developing while testing the code. we use react, jest, RSpec so far. and i notice it helps make our code more dynamic.

5. HTTP: Hyper Text Transfer Protocol. The protocal used to connect to web servers.
