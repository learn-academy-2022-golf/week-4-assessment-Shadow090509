1. What is object-oriented programming? How is it different than functional programming?

Your answer: From my understanding, that means that most(if not all things are objects) I think this would be slightly easier to mannage and just apply classes to the objects in stead of having to create the objects as well.

Researched answer: OOP was made to make it easier to work with large software systems. a way to create containers for data that can be changed and manipulated without messing up the rest of the program.
